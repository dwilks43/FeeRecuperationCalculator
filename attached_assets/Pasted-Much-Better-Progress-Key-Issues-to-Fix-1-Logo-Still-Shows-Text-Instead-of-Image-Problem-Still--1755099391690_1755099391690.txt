Much Better Progress! Key Issues to Fix:
1. Logo Still Shows Text Instead of Image
Problem: Still displaying "DMP Logo" text
Fix: The base64 SVG isn't rendering. Tell them to:

<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjgwIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjQwIDgwIiBmaWxsPSJub25lIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPg0KPHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjI0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MCIgZmlsbD0iIzBlYTVlOSIvPg0KPHR0ZXh0IHg9IjEyMCIgeT0iNDUiIGZvbnQtZmFtaWx5PSJzZXJpZiIgZm9udC1zaXplPSIyNCIgZm9udC13ZWlnaHQ9ImJvbGQiIGZpbGw9IndoaXRlIiB0ZXh0LWFuY2hvcj0ibWlkZGxlIj5ETVAuPC90ZXh0Pg0KPC9zdmc+" 
     class="company-logo" alt="DMP Logo" style="width: 60px; height: auto;" />
2. Processing Savings Cards Need Proper Styling
Problem: Cards are in a row but lack visual separation and colors
Fix: Add these exact CSS classes:

.summary-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
.summary-card {
    background: #f8fafc;
    border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 1rem;
    text-align: center;
}
.summary-card.savings {
    background: #f0fdf4;
    border-color: #22c55e;
}
.value {
    font-size: 18pt;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: #004ED3;
}
.savings-positive { color: #059669; }
.savings-negative { color: #dc2626; }
3. Header Alignment Issues
Problem: Company text and quote meta aren't properly aligned
Fix: Ensure the header uses this exact structure:

.quote-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: flex-start;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    padding-bottom: 1.5rem;
    border-bottom: 3px solid #0ea5e9;
}
4. Remove the "Quote Summary" Section
Problem: Showing business info that doesn't belong in a savings calculator
Fix: Remove the entire merchant details section - this is a savings calculator, not a quote

5. Fix Negative Savings Display
Problem: Showing -$4670.97 which indicates the calculation is wrong
Fix: This suggests their calculation logic is incorrect. The savings should always be positive if the new cost is lower.

Final Instructions:
Remove business details section - keep only savings cards, parameters, and volume analysis
Fix the logo rendering with the exact HTML above
Apply the complete card styling - this is what makes it professional
Verify calculation logic - negative savings indicates a math error
Test HTML in browser first before sending to DocRaptor
The layout is almost perfect - it's now just styling details and removing irrelevant sections that separate amateur from professional appearance.
