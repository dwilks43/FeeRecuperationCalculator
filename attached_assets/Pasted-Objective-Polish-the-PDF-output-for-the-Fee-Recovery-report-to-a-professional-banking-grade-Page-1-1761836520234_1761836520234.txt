Objective

Polish the PDF output for the Fee Recovery report to a professional, banking-grade Page 1 while keeping the existing data and downstream pages intact. Keep the left side as a 1-to-1 of our UI metrics, add a brief Executive Summary above it, and convert the right side into a decision column (Savings Allocation, Service & Implementation, Next Steps). Move Customer Information to Page 2. Keep DocRaptor/Prince-CSS constraints in mind (no external fonts, conservative layout).

Scope of Work

Page 1 only: new header + two-column layout.

Force Customer Information and Inputs/Assumptions to Page 2.

Light CSS nudge for banking tone (type scale, spacing, number alignment).

No recomputation: all numbers are rendered from the frozen calculatedValues snapshot.

Page 1 – Structure

Add a top card titled Executive Summary with one paragraph:

“This analysis is presented by Dynamic Merchant Processing (DMP) to illustrate the savings realized from the {{programType}} program based on inputs provided for {{merchantName}} on {{reportDate}}. Figures are estimates derived from the current processing profile and card-mix assumptions.”

Below it, create a two-column grid (≈ 1.6:1 ratio).

Left Column (keep the UI truth)

Heading: Your Monthly Impact (keep this title).

Three KPIs (same data as current UI):

Monthly Savings (Est.) → ${monthlySavings} and “Annualized: ${annualSavings}”

Cost Reduction vs Today → ${costReductionPct}%

Program → ${programType} with a small “Compliant” tag

Add a simple two-bar comparison (Today vs With Program). Scale both bars to the max of the two costs so the longer bar is 100%. Display ${todayCost} and ${newProgramNetCost} to the right.

Add a mini waterfall table showing:

Current Processing Cost → ${todayCost}

Processor Charge on Cards → ${processorCharge}

− Price Differential Collected → ${diffCollected}

= Net Processing Cost (Program) → ${newProgramNetCost}

Include a one-line caption: “Details and assumptions appear on Page 2.”

Right Column (decision support, no compliance block)

Savings Allocation Plan (3 bullets):

${monthlySavings} per month → short use case (e.g., allocation1)

quarterlySavings = monthlySavings * 3 → allocation2

${annualSavings} per year → allocation3
Use concise, vertical-specific copy the rep can set (e.g., restaurants: “two server shifts/week”, “beer/wine reorder”, “handheld upgrade”).

Service & Implementation

Three bullets, banking-calm tone:

Best-in-class service, led by POS professionals who manage the changeover end-to-end.

Structured onboarding with menu/config migration and staff orientation.

Post-go-live support via rapid-response service desk.

Next Steps (no QR):

3 steps: Confirm inputs & program → Schedule installation window → Go live and review first statement to verify savings.

Contact line: rep name, email (mailto), phone.

Page 2 and Later

Insert a page break after the Page 1 block so Customer Information and Inputs & Assumptions start at the top of Page 2.

Leave existing detailed tables and appendix content as-is, aside from the global style updates below.

Styling Guardrails (DocRaptor/Prince-CSS friendly)

Keep system font stack (no external fonts). Base 12px; H1 ~22px; H2 ~14px; small ~10px.

Use tabular/lining numerals for all numeric cells; right-align money/percents.

Light card borders, generous padding, muted brand palette (one primary + neutral grays).

Add page numbers in the footer if not already present.

Avoid awkward splits: apply break-inside: avoid to KPI cards and tables.

Data & Formatting Rules

Single source of truth: All numbers must come from the frozen Step-4 snapshot (calculatedValues). Do not recompute in the template.

Rounding consistency: One shared currency/percent formatter; every repeated figure must match everywhere.

Bar widths: todayBarPct and newProgBarPct scaled against max(todayCost, newProgramNetCost).

Derived values: quarterlySavings = monthlySavings * 3.

Null safety: Guard optional fields (e.g., city/state) to avoid “undefinedundefined”. Hide rows/cards if the underlying value is null/empty.

Content Hygiene

Keep “Your Monthly Impact” title (user preference).

Use Executive Summary tone at the top; remove salesy taglines (no “Start keeping what you earn”; no urgency clocks).

Show the “Trusted by …” line once elsewhere (footer or last page), not on Page 1.

Acceptance Criteria

Page 1 shows: Executive Summary paragraph, left column with KPIs + simple compare + mini waterfall, right column with Savings Allocation, Service & Implementation, Next Steps.

Customer Information begins at the top of Page 2.

All numeric columns are aligned; repeated figures are identical across the document.

No visual regressions on later pages; no overflow or awkward page breaks.

No missing/undefined placeholders rendered; no external font requests.

The PDF feels conservative and boardroom-ready (banking tone), with the UI truth preserved.
