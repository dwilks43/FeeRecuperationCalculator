DMP Monthly Toggle Implementation
What It Shows
The toggle should display the monthly profitability that DMP earns from the merchant's account,.
Math Formula
// DMP Monthly Profitability Calculation
dmpMonthlyProfit = markupCollected - netCost
// Where:
// markupCollected = baseVolume * priceDifferential
// netCost = processingFees - markupCollected
Example Calculation
Using $100,000 volume with 6% price differential:
•	Base Volume: $76,923 (after removing tax/tip)
•	Markup Collected: $76,923 × 6% = $4,615
•	Processing Fees: $106,000 × 4% = $4,240
•	Net Cost: $4,240 - $4,615 = -$375 (merchant saves)
•	DMP Monthly Profit: $4,615 - (-$375) = $4,990
Implementation
const calculateDMPProfitability = () => {
  const baseVolume = creditCardVolume / (1 + taxRate + tipRate);
  const markupCollected = baseVolume * priceDifferential;
  const adjustedVolume = baseVolume * (1 + priceDifferential) * (1 + taxRate + tipRate);
  const processingFees = adjustedVolume * flatRatePercent;
  const netCost = processingFees - markupCollected;
  
  return markupCollected - netCost;
};

Base Volume
"Your actual sales volume before taxes and tips are added. Calculated as: Credit Card Volume ÷ (1 + Tax Rate + Tip Rate)"
Marked Up Volume
"Base volume after applying the price differential. Calculated as: Base Volume × (1 + Price Differential)"
Adjusted Volume
"Final transaction volume after adding back taxes and tips. This is what gets processed through DMP."
Markup Collected
"Total monthly revenue collected from the price differential. Calculated as: Base Volume × Price Differential"
Processing Fees

Processing Savings Section Tooltips
Current Processing Cost
"What you currently pay monthly for credit card processing. Calculated as: Credit Card Volume × Current Processing Rate"
New Processing Cost
"Your actual out-of-pocket cost with DMP's dual pricing system. Calculated as: Processing Fees - Markup Collected. Negative amounts mean you earn money from processing."
