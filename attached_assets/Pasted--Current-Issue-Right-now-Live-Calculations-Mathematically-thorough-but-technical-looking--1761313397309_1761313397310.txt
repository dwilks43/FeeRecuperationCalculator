⚠️ Current Issue

Right now:

Live Calculations = Mathematically thorough, but “technical looking.”

Savings Summary = Shows similar numbers but doesn’t emotionally hit the merchant.

Problem → Too much information, not enough impact. The eye doesn’t immediately land on “Here’s how much extra money you'll keep every month.”

✅ Goal

Make the bottom half of the UI (and matching PDF) act like a closing tool, not just a calculator.

We want:

Left side → For the sales rep (proof, breakdown).

Right side → For the merchant (emotion, simplicity, $$ impact).

Savings must “jump off the page” instantly.

🔥 Recommended Layout Change
✅ Left Column → “How It Works (Optional Detail)”

Keep Live Calculations but collapse it by default:

Title: “How It Works (Details)”

Accordion-style dropdown.

Shows Base Volume, Fees, Tip Choice, Taxes, etc.

This is for the analytical rep or CFO-type customer.

✅ Right Column → “Your Savings” (High-Impact Visual Section)

Replace the Savings Summary box with:

Element	Design	Purpose
Monthly Savings	🌟 Big, bold, green dollar amount (e.g., $636.88)	Instantly grabs attention.
Annual Savings	Slightly smaller but bold (e.g., $7,642.56/year)**	Drives big-picture thinking.
% Saved vs Today	Subheading (e.g., “You are saving 97% of your processing costs”)	Psychological punch.
Cash Back/Net Gain	If Fee Collected on Cash is positive, show “You earn $200 per month from cash customers.”	Shifts mindset: “not only saving—profiting.”
New Cost to Process Cards	“Your new cost to accept cards: –$13.12 (you’re net ahead!)”	Reinforces value over current system.
🎯 Psychological Enhancements

✅ Use color logic: Green = money gained / savings; Red = what they pay today.

✅ Add equivalents under annual savings:

“= 2 new ovens”

“= 1 extra server’s annual wages”

“= $6,165 back into your pocket”
(configurable per industry)

✅ Add a small tagline under the dollar savings:

“This is money you’re currently giving to Visa/MC every month.”

📄 PDF Version Should Follow Same Logic

In your PDF (like the one you attached 

DMP-Savings-Report (89)

), restructure the top half as:

Monthly Savings:      $636.88 ✅
Annual Savings:       $7,642.56 ✅
You Currently Pay:    $450.00 ❌
New Net Cost:         -$13.12 ✅ (You’re net positive)
Coverage %:           97%
Cash Collected:       $200.00 / month


Then put “Derived Bases & Totals” underneath in smaller print.

🛠 Next Steps I Can Build for You

If you want, I can now:
✔ Generate the JSON update to restructure this UI
✔ Write the PDF layout update for DocRaptor (matching this layout)
✔ Build conditional formatting rules to color and bold the savings dynamically
✔ Write a “Sales Script Version” so reps know exactly how to present it
